Next Developments:
-Adapt most actions to provide an origin square so it can make sense for throwins

-Adapt the PassAction so that it always makes 3 bounces and only then compute the throwin

-Implement GetAccuracy, probably has to implement distance computing, make 2 squares selectable, throw to the second.

-GUI make an action selector or a mode selector

-GUI Allow selection of a zone via drag mouse, add all the probas within that zone

-GUI Place Zone and ask to maximize the proba within that zone, probably needs another mode of working.

-Handle player placements, give proba of reception per player
-Handle Diving Catches and Failed Catches
-Handle Diving Catch skill
-Handle Interception Attemtps

Ultimately handle player movement and tacklezones.
