Definitions:
Bounce Action: Dice 8 -> move 1 square in that direction. On oob throw-in.
KickOff Action: Dice 8 -> dice 6 -> bounce action (1) /  Bounce Action (2). On oob, give to a player.
Pass Action: Get Accuracy -> Scatter Action (3). On oob at end of scatter throw-in
Throw-In Action: Dice 3 -> Dice 2d6 -> Bounce Action(1). On oob throw-in again.

Dice 8 or 3 are for direction.
Dice 6 are for distance.

Next Developments:
-Adapt most actions to provide an origin square so it can make sense for throwins

-Adapt the PassAction so that it always makes 3 bounces and only then compute the throwin

-Implement GetAccuracy, probably has to implement distance computing, make 2 squares selectable, throw to the second.

-GUI make an action selector or a mode selector

-GUI Allow selection of a zone via drag mouse, add all the probas within that zone

-GUI Place Zone and ask to maximize the proba within that zone, probably needs another mode of working.

-Handle player placements, give proba of reception per player
-Handle Diving Catches and Failed Catches
-Handle Diving Catch skill
-Handle Interception Attemtps

Ultimately handle player movement and tacklezones.
